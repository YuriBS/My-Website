    <h1><strong>superhero</strong></h1>

    <p>
        <br> A <strong>superhero</strong> (sometimes rendered super-hero or super hero) is a type of heroic stock character
        who possesses supernatural <sup>1</sup><br> or <em>superhuman powers and who is dedicated to fighting crime, protecting the public, and usually battling supervillains.</em>        A female <strong>superhero</strong> is sometimes called a <strong>superhero</strong>ine (also rendered super-heroine
        or super heroine), although the word <strong>superhero</strong> is commonly used for females also. <strong>superhero</strong>        fiction is the genre of fiction that is centered on such characters, especially in American comic books since the
        1930s. By most definitions, characters do not require actual superhuman powers or phenomena to be deemed <strong>superhero</strong>es.[1][2][3]
        While the Dictionary.com definition of "<strong>superhero</strong>" is "a figure, especially in a comic strip or
        cartoon, endowed with superhuman powers and usually portrayed as fighting evil or crime",[4] the longstanding Merriam-Webster
        dictionary gives the definition as "a fictional hero having extraordinary or superhuman powers; also: an exceptionally
        skillful or successful person".[5] Terms such as masked crime fighters, costumed adventurers or masked vigilantes
        are sometimes used to refer to characters such as the Spirit, who may not be explicitly referred to as <strong>superhero</strong>es
        but nevertheless share similar traits. Some <strong>superhero</strong>es use their powers to counter daily crime
        while also combating threats against humanity from supervillains, who are their criminal counterparts. Often at least
        one of these supervillains will be the <strong>superhero</strong>'s archenemy. Some long-running <strong>superhero</strong>es
        such as Batman, Spider-Man, Superman, Captain America, Wonder Woman, Iron Man, the Flash, Wolverine, Green Lantern,
        and Hulk have a rogues gallery of many villains.

    <h1>History</h1>

    <p>

        History[edit] Main articles: <strong>superhero</strong> fiction § History, History of comics, and <strong>superhero</strong>        film Early history[edit] The word '
        <strong>superhero</strong>' dates to at least 1917.[6] Antecedents of the archetype include such folkloric heroes
        as Robin Hood, who adventured in distinctive clothing.[7] The 1903 play The Scarlet Pimpernel and its spinoffs popularized
        the idea of a masked avenger and the <strong>superhero</strong> trope of a secret identity.[7] Shortly afterward,
        masked and costumed pulp fiction characters such as Zorro (1919), The Shadow (1930) and comic strip heroes, such
        as the Phantom (1936) began appearing, as did non-costumed characters with super strength, including Patoruzú (1928),
        the comic-strip character Popeye (1929) and novelist Philip Wylie's protagonist Hugo Danner (1930).[8] In the 1930s,
        both trends came together in some of the earliest superpowered costumed heroes such as Japan's Ōgon Bat[9][10] (visualized
        in painted panels used by kamishibai oral storytellers in Japan since 1931), Mandrake the Magician[11][12][13] (1934),
        Superman in 1938 and Captain Marvel (1939) at the beginning of the Golden Age of Comic Books.

    Common traits[edit] Many <strong>superhero</strong> characters display the following traits:

</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Extraordinary powers or abilities. <strong>superhero</strong> powers vary widely; superhuman strength, the ability
        to fly, enhanced senses, and the projection of energy bolts are all common. Some characters like Batman, Mockingbird,
        the Phantom and the Question possess no superhuman powers but have mastered skills such as martial arts, espionage
        techniques, and applied or forensic sciences to a highly remarkable degree. Others rely on fantastical weapons or
        technology, such as Iron Man's powered armor suits, Green Lantern’s power ring, and trick arrows employed by Green
        Arrow and Hawkeye. Many characters supplement their innate superhuman powers with a special weapon or device (e.g.
        Captain America's shield, Wonder Woman's lasso and bracelets, Thor's weather manipulating hammer, and Wolverine's
        adamantium claws). A strong moral code, including a willingness to risk one's own safety in the service of good without
        expectation of reward. Such a code often includes a refusal or strong reluctance to kill or wield lethal weapons.

        A motivation, such as a sense of responsibility and guilt (e.g. Spider-Man), an altruistic calling (e.g. Wonder Woman), a
        childhood trauma or personal vendetta against criminals (e.g. Batman), or a strong belief in justice and humanitarian
        service (e.g. Superman).
